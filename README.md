# Project Title: project-9 readme generator

# Description

This was my homework #9 readme generator. In this homework, the objective was to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README file froma user's input using the inquirer package. I completed this homework by first creating array of questions in index.js which would hold all the questions to ask to to create a README. Also, once the questions were created along with function init, I went back to generateMarkdown.js file to build out a template in which how a dynamically README file would be generated. The first three functions in the file were mainly used for licenseing badge, license link, and license section. After that on the function generateMarkdown, I gave each different heading/section and what data it would hold from user input generated data.
